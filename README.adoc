:toc:
:icons: font

== Overview

The BufferManager library provides a simple and efficient way to manage memory blocks in C++ applications, particularly for embedded systems or Arduino projects. It includes two main classes: `Block` and `BufferManager`.

== Features

* Manage multiple memory blocks with customizable element count and size
* Add and remove blocks dynamically
* Calculate total memory usage
* Lightweight and suitable for resource-constrained environments

== Installation

1. Download the library from the GitHub repository.
2. Place the library folder in your Arduino `libraries` directory.
3. Include the library in your sketch using `#include <BufferManager.h>`.

== Usage

Create a `BufferManager` instance and add blocks as needed:

```cpp
#include <BufferManager.h>

BufferManager manager(10); // Supports up to 10 blocks
manager.addBlock(100, 2);  // Add a block with 100 elements of 2 bytes each
```
